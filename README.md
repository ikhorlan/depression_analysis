# depression_analysis

This EDA includes two datasets from Kaggle. One includes depression levels with demographic and economic determinants. The goal of this EDA is to analyze which determinant influence depression levels. The second dataset includes data on depression among students. It also includes some demographic data such as age and the year of study and depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and depression diagnosis and treatment. Mental health is an important public health issue and the goal of this EDA to suggest public health interventions to improve mental health.

Summary: The depressions levels are higher among farmers (incoming_own_farm). However, farmers are older on average, have more children, have lower educational level and have bigger families. Farmers have higher economic indicators such as income and expenses. Depressions among farmers maybe influences by many demographic and economic factors. 

The logistic regression of data and its role in depressions levels showed that, among demographic factors, age, number of children and family size increase depression and being marries and education decrease depression. Among economic factors, increase assets and salaries increase depression and expenses decrease depression. However farm related income and expenses are assocaited with decreased depression.

Depressions among students

The correlation analysis above shows that depressiveness among sudents is highly correlated with siocidal feelings.

The goupby method by depression severity shows higher increasing suicidal feelings in more severe depressions. Depressions is diagnosed and treated better in patients with minimal and mild depression but much less diagnosed and treated in moderate and severe depressions.

Depressions severity and suicidal feelings are highers in years 1 and 2 and it decreases in years 3 and 4 of education (university/college). While it is almost 100% treated when it is diagnosed, it is only diagnosed among 25% to 50% of those feeling depressed. Similarly, anxiety is treated among 100% of diagnosed with clinical anxiety it is diagnosed among 15% to 55% of students feeling anxious. Anxiety is higher among year 1 and 2 students and decreased by year 4. 

Summary: Depressiveness and anxiousness are correlated with suicidal feeling (more depression than anxiety) and both of these indicators are higher in years 1 and 2. It is important to work with the first years students to educate them about symptoms and where to find help. It would be good to offer counseling about mental health to students of all years but especially to students of the first two years of education.
